A simple example of building a Telegram bot with Python designed for those interested in this field.
Now I have provided the code on this page so that you can make it easier for you to build a Telegram bot and develop your own code.

- Now what about the robot itself?

Well, the point is that we launched a very simple game that used the `telebot` framework in this part.

The game is such that the system chooses a number between 0 and 100 and asks the user to guess it.
As much as possible, the robot helps the user to find the number, and if the user finds the number, he wins.

My own record is in 4 guesses, how many guesses do you think you can find it???
